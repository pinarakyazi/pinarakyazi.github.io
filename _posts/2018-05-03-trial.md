Hellooo I'm trying to create a markdown post!

**Let's do some bold stuff**

Can I insert a picture?  

<img src="/img/poolc.png"
     alt="Trying again!"
     style="width: 300px;" /><br/>
<sup>Let's see... Small title for my figure

# My my a big header

### how about a small one?


I'm gonna do a quote below:
