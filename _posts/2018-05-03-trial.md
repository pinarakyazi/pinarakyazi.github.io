Hellooo I'm trying to create a markdown post!

**Let's do some bold stuff**

Can I insert a picture?  
![I'll try the picture above...](https://github.com/pinarakyazi/pinarakyazi.github.io/blob/master/img/posts/07.jpg "whatever"){:class="img-responsive"}

Let's see... 

# My my a big header

### how about a small one?


I'm gonna do a quote below:
